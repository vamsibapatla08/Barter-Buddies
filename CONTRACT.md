# API Contract

The agreement between the FastAPI backend and the React frontend. If an endpoint's shape changes, update this file in the same PR.

Request and response shapes come from the Pydantic models in [Backend/app/models.py](Backend/app/models.py). Those models are the source of truth. If this file and the models disagree, the models win, and this file should be fixed. The [Shapes](#shapes) section below lists every field.

Vamsi's endpoints don't have models yet, so their shapes in the table are still placeholders.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Owner | Request body | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/feed?category=` | Vamsi | — | `200` list of listings | `category` is optional; omit it for all categories. |
| GET | `/skills` | Vamsi | — | `200` list of skills | Requires authentication; returns the selectable skill IDs, labels, and categories. |
| GET | `/listings/{id}` | Vamsi | — | `200` one listing | `404` if the listing doesn't exist. |
| POST | `/listings` | Vamsi | `{ title, description, category }` | `201` the created listing | Owner is taken from the JWT, not the body. |
| POST | `/wants` | Vamsi | `{ title, description, category }` | `201` the created want | Owner is taken from the JWT. Wants feed into matching. |
| GET | `/me` | Vamsi | — | `200` my profile, rank, stats | The profile of whoever the JWT belongs to. |
| GET | `/profiles/{id}` | Vamsi | — | `200` profile with reviews | `404` if the user doesn't exist. |
| GET | `/notifications` | Vamsi | — | `200` `{ unread: number }` | Unread count only. |
| GET | `/matches` | Abhyuday | — | `200` `MatchOut[]` | Sorted by `score`, best first. Excludes the caller. |
| POST | `/exchanges` | Abhyuday | `ExchangeIn` | `201` `ExchangeOut` | The requester is taken from the JWT. Starts in `proposed`. `400` if `recipient_id` is yourself or `source` isn't `"browse"` or `"match"`. |
| GET | `/exchanges/{id}` | Abhyuday | — | `200` `ExchangeOut` | `403` if you aren't the `requester` or `recipient`. `404` if it doesn't exist. |
| GET | `/exchanges/mine` | Abhyuday | — | `200` `LedgerOut` | Each of the four keys is an `ExchangeSummary[]`. Register this route before `/exchanges/{id}` so `mine` isn't read as an id. |
| POST | `/exchanges/{id}/respond` | Abhyuday | `RespondIn` | `200` `ExchangeOut` | Recipient only (`403` otherwise). `action: "accept"` → `accepted`, `action: "decline"` → `declined`. `400` for any other `action`. `409` if the exchange isn't `proposed`. |
| POST | `/exchanges/{id}/lock` | Abhyuday | — | `200` `ExchangeOut` | Freezes the terms. `accepted` → `locked` and sets `locked_at`. `409` from any other status. |
| POST | `/exchanges/{id}/complete` | Abhyuday | — | `200` `ExchangeOut` | Sets the caller's `requester_completed` or `recipient_completed` to `true`. Status stays `locked` until both are `true`, then moves to `completed`. `409` if the exchange isn't `locked`. |
| POST | `/reviews` | Abhyuday | `ReviewIn` | `201` `ReviewOut` | The reviewer is taken from the JWT. Only for a `completed` exchange you were part of. `409` if you've already reviewed it. |

## Shapes

These mirror [Backend/app/models.py](Backend/app/models.py). `?` marks an optional field that may be `null`. Timestamps (`created_at`, `locked_at`) are strings.

## Auth

Every request sends:

```
Authorization: Bearer <supabase jwt>
```

The backend verifies the token with `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` and takes the user id from it. A missing, invalid or expired token returns `401`.

## Error shape

Every error except `422` returns:

```json
{ "detail": "message" }
```

This is FastAPI's default `HTTPException` output. `detail` is a string you can show to the user as is.

### 422: validation failed

FastAPI returns `422` on its own when a request body doesn't match the Pydantic model, for example a missing field or a wrong type. For `422` only, `detail` is a **list of error objects**, not a string:

```json
{
  "detail": [
    { "type": "missing", "loc": ["body", "terms", "when"], "msg": "Field required", "input": { } }
  ]
}
```

On the frontend:

- **`422`:** show a generic message such as "Something was wrong with that request." Don't render `detail` directly.
- **Every other error:** show `detail` directly.

## Status codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | OK |
| `201` | Created (any POST that creates a new row) |
| `400` | Bad request: the body is well formed, but a value isn't allowed (for example, proposing to yourself or an unknown `action`) |
| `401` | No valid JWT |
| `403` | Valid JWT, but you aren't allowed to do this |
| `404` | Not found |
| `409` | Conflict: the action doesn't fit the current state (for example, locking an exchange that isn't accepted) |
| `422` | Validation failed: the body doesn't match the model. `detail` is a list, not a string (see [422: validation failed](#422-validation-failed)) |

## Exchange status

An exchange is always in exactly one of these five states:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `proposed` | Sent, waiting for the recipient to respond |
| `accepted` | Recipient agreed; terms can still be discussed |
| `locked` | Terms are frozen; waiting for both sides to confirm completion |
| `completed` | Both sides confirmed; reviews are open |
| `declined` | Recipient said no (final) |

```
proposed ──► accepted ──► locked ──► completed
    │
    └──────► declined
```

## Not part of the API

These go from the browser directly to Supabase and never reach the backend:

- **Login**
- **Signup**
- **Chat**
